The Bonita Continuous Delivery (BCD) add-on provides a solution to use _Continuous Delivery_ practice for your Bonita Living Application development and deployment.

It is composed of two parts:

* First, a framework for *Continuous Integration* of Living Applications. +
BCD lets you build a Living Application repository and deploy the generated artifacts from the command line. Besides, a pre-configured standalone https://jenkins.io/[Jenkins CI] environment is also provided with BCD.
* Second, a solution for *Provisioning* of Bonita stacks on cloud or on-premises hosts. +
BCD lets you deploy Bonita on existing servers using https://www.docker.com/what-container[Docker] containers. Furthermore, when used with the https://aws.amazon.com/[Amazon Web Services (AWS) cloud platform], BCD enables you to create and delete https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/[AWS EC2 instances] automatically.

Basic concepts
// {.h2}

This add-on provides a `bcd` command-line interface (BCD CLI) which enables to:

* Build and deploy Bonita Living Applications
* Deploy a full Bonita stack - A *Bonita stack* is formed by a database service, Bonita Docker containers running Tomcat application servers and a HAProxy load balancer when deploying a multi-node Bonita cluster.

The BCD CLI is provided within a ready-to-use environment called *BCD Controller*. This environment is packaged as a Docker image. +
Then a controller container will have to be started interactively on your control host from which `bcd` commands will be issued.

::: warning
It is highly recommended to have a clear understanding of https://docs.docker.com/engine/docker-overview/[Docker essential concepts] prior to reading this documentation.
