The Bonita Continuous Delivery (BCD) add-on provides a solution to use _Continuous Delivery_ practice for your Bonita Living Application development and deployment.

It is composed of two parts:

*   First, a solution for **provisioning** of a Bonita stack on cloud or on-premises hosts
*   Second, a framework for **continuous delivery** of Living Applications

The BCD add-on is compatible with [Amazon AWS cloud platform](https://aws.amazon.com/), on premises servers and local virtual machines via [Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com/).  
It is powered by [Docker containerization solution](https://www.docker.com/) and [Ansible automation framework](https://www.ansible.com/).

::: warning
It is highly recommended to have a clear understanding of [Docker essential concepts](https://docs.docker.com/engine/docker-overview/) prior to reading this documentation.

Basic concepts <!--{.h2}-->

This add-on provides a `bcd` command-line interface (BCD CLI) which enables to:

*   deploy a full Bonita stack
*   build and deploy Bonita Living Applications

A **Bonita stack** is formed by a database service, Bonita Docker containers running Tomcat application servers and a HAProxy load balancer when deploying a multi-node Bonita cluster.

The BCD CLI is provided within a ready-to-use environment called **BCD Controller**. This environment is packaged as a Docker image.  
Then a controller container will have to be started interactively on your control workstation from which `bcd` commands will be issued.

Architecture overview <!--{.h2}-->

Here is an overview of how BCD drives the provisioning of a Bonita stack.

![BCD Architecture Overview](images/bonita_platform_stack.png "BCD Architecture Overview")

*   A **Host** can be a AWS EC2 instance or an on-premises server.
*   The control workstation bind mounts some essential files with the controller container including:
    *   `~/bonita-continuous-delivery` - used as a working directory for BCD CLI known as the `BCD_HOME` directory
    *   `~/.ssh/private_key` - used to allow SSH access to target hosts
    *   `~/.boto` - credential to your AWS account (if any)
