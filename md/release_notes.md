# Release notes

## Breaking changes
The following changes introduce incompatibility with BCD 3.2:
* BCD livingapp default deployment mode is now _Production_. To maintain the behavior of the deploy command prior to BCD 3.3.0 (aka. deployment for _Development_ environments), make sure to add the `--development-mode` option to your `livingapp deploy` commands.

Example:

```bash
bcd -s <scenario> livingapp deploy -p <application_path> -c <configuration_path> --development-mode
```

## Limitations and known issues

* The same BCD stack cannot be managed with multiple BCD controller instances due to the use of Terraform "local" backend.
* Due to [Ansible issue #35255](https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/35255) the warning message "could not match supplied host pattern" is displayed when there is no load balancer required for a noncluster deployment:
  ```
  [WARNING]: Could not match supplied host pattern, ignoring: load_balancer
  ```

## What's new in 3.3.0 (2020-03-01)

* With release 3.3.0, BCD introduces deployment modes (_Development_ and _Production_) to manage artifacts deployment policies more easily.

::: warning
The default deployment policies are changing from the previous BCD versions. 
The new deployment policies are more conservative:

|                          |3.2.1 and previous versions                          |3.3.0 and later versions                                                 |
