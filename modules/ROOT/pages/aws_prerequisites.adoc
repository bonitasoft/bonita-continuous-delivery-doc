= How to configure Amazon Web Services (AWS) for BCD

[IMPORTANT]
====
The provisioning part of BCD is now **DEPRECATED** and will be **REMOVED** ! We do not recommend using it.
====


This tutorial describes how to configure Amazon Web Services (AWS) for BCD. +
These configuration steps are required to allow BCD to programmatically manage your AWS instances and to be able to connect to your Bonita stack.

== Sign Up for AWS

If you do not have an Amazon Web Services account yet, first sign up as described in this AWS user guide: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/get-set-up-for-amazon-ec2.html#sign-up-for-aws[Sign Up for AWS].

== AWS Setup for BCD

In order to use Amazon EC2 instances, some configuration steps need to be performed as a prerequisite.
The following steps are the basic requirements to set up AWS credentials for Ansible automation. +
Further configuration instructions for *AWS single sign-on* can be found xref:aws_sso.adoc[on this page].

. http://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/access_policies_create.html[Create an IAM Policy] to grant full access to Amazon EC2 on a specific region (eg. us-west-2)
 ** *Policy name*: EC2FullAccess_us-west-2
 ** *Policy document*:

  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
      {
          "Action": "ec2:*",
          "Effect": "Allow",
          "Resource": "*",
          "Condition": {
              "StringEquals": {
                  "ec2:Region": "us-west-2"
              }
          }
      }
  ]
 }

. Create an IAM Policy to give https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_roles_use_passrole.html[PassRole] permission in order to be able to associate a specific role with the EC2 instances of a cluster.

_For some usage you may be interested to create a role and attach to it the corresponding policies, see xref:aws_sso.adoc[Configure AWS single sign-on] or xref:aws_organizations.adoc[Assume IAM role within AWS Organizations]._
. Create an IAM Policy to allow ec2 instances of a cluster to autodiscover themselves on a specific region (eg. us-west-2).

          ],
          "Effect": "Allow",
          "Resource": "*",
          "Condition": {
              "StringEquals": {

WARNING: Pay attention that for security reasons, pushing AWS user credentials to EC2 instances (as done with BCD 1.0.x) is no longer supported.

BCD is compatible with official Ubuntu cloud images as EC2 AMI (Amazon Machine Images). +
Use the https://cloud-images.ubuntu.com/locator/ec2/[Amazon EC2 AMI Locator] tools to identify IDs of such images.

== Dynamic EC2 inventory configuration

When deploying to AWS, BCD uses http://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/intro_dynamic_inventory.html#example-aws-ec2-external-inventory-script[dynamic Amazon EC2 inventory] with a `ec2_wrapper.sh` script.

This `ec2_wrapper.sh` script can be further configured with the `ec2.ini.j2` template.

For instance, if you are running the BCD controller *from outside EC2*, the `vpc_destination_variable` parameter should be set to `ip_address`. If you are running the BCD controller *from within EC2*, the `vpc_destination_variable` parameter should be set to `private_ip_address`. +
This parameter is managed by the `ec2_vpc_destination_variable` BCD variable.

More information on dynamic EC2 inventory management can be found in https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/apn/getting-started-with-ansible-and-dynamic-amazon-ec2-inventory-management/[this blog post].
