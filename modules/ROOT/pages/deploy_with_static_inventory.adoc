= How to deploy with a static inventory

[IMPORTANT]
====
The provisioning part of BCD is now **DEPRECATED** and will be **REMOVED** ! We do not recommend using it.
====

BCD lets you deploy a Bonita stack on your existing hosts using a *static inventory*. +
On this page, you will find detailed information about the usage of BCD with your existing hosts. We will also provide an example creating virtual machines with https://www.vagrantup.com/[Vagrant] and deploying a Bonita stack with BCD.

== Preparing configuration files

There are two main files to configure: an *Ansible inventory* and a *BCD scenario*.

=== Inventory

This file defines the hosts and groups of hosts upon which BCD will operates. The preferred location for inventory files is the `ansible/inventory` directory.

In particular, you will find examples of static inventory files in the `static-inventory` subdirectory.

NOTE: Refer to https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/2.9/user_guide/intro_inventory.html[Ansible's documentation] for further details about Ansible inventories.


=== Scenario

Scenarios follow the same rules as described in the xref:scenarios.adoc[Scenario file reference documentation]. There are five mandatory variables to configure while using BCD with static inventories:

* `bcd_provider`: Infrastructure provider. It has to be set with `static_inventory`
* `ansible_ssh_user`: The ssh user to use.
* `ansible_ssh_private_key_file`: Private key file used by ssh.
* `bcd_inventory`: Ansible inventory path required when `bcd_provider` is `static_inventory`
* `configuration`: Configuration filename used to group variables for common deployment types.

An example scenario is provided with the `scenarios/static_inventory.yml.EXAMPLE` file.

== Example with Vagrant

This section describes a complete example of Bonita stack deployment on existing virtual machines created with Vagrant.

WARNING: For this tutorial, it is highly recommended to have a clear understanding of https://www.vagrantup.com/intro[Vagrant].


NOTE: This tutorial is adapted to Linux and Mac environments only.


=== Requirements

* First, https://www.vagrantup.com/downloads.html[Vagrant] and https://www.virtualbox.org/[Virtualbox] as a hypervisor must be installed on your host.
* Second, you will need to create and configure your host machine using your https://www.vagrantup.com/docs/vagrantfile/[Vagrantfile]. An example of `Vagrantfile` is provided in the `vagrant` directory. You can find an
example for one or two machines infrastructure.
* Third, you need to define your infrastructure and Bonita stack with a scenario. An example scenario file named *vagrant_single.yml.EXAMPLE* is provided in the *scenarios* directory. For more information you can read the *xref:scenarios.adoc[BCD Scenario reference]*.
* Finally, the virtual machine that you will create must have access to the Internet because some packages will be updated/installed.

=== Step-by-step tutorial

Here is a complete example using the configuration files provided.

WARNING: This example uses an insecure private key. See https://www.vagrantup.com/docs/vagrantfile/ssh_settings.html[more]...


Assuming you have a `bonita-continuous-delivery_3.4.1` directory in your `$HOME` directory.

==== 1. Prepare and start your target virtual machine

This step will create and configure a single virtual machine with an IP *192.168.10.10* defined in `Vagrantfile`.

On your host machine:

[source,bash]
----
$ cd $HOME/bonita-continuous-delivery_3.4.1/vagrant/1-machine/

$ vagrant up
Bringing machine 'bonita-stack' up with 'virtualbox' provider...
==> bonita-stack: Importing base box 'ubuntu/xenial64'...
[...]
==> bonita-stack: Setting up libpython-stdlib:amd64 (2.7.12-1~16.04) ...
==> bonita-stack: Setting up python (2.7.12-1~16.04) ...

$ VBoxManage list runningvms
"1-machine_bonita-stack_1525085617284_45644" {553ff7af-4d9a-4325-a902-ae17edce1e54}
----

==== 2. Launch your BCD controller and deploy Bonita stack

Copy the *vagrant_single.yml.EXAMPLE* to a *scenarios/vagrant_single.yml* file. Edit your scenario as necessary and start a BCD controller.

[source,bash]
----
$ docker run --rm -ti --hostname bcd-controller --name bcd-controller \
        -v ~/bonita-continuous-delivery_3.4.1:/home/bonita/bonita-continuous-delivery \
        -v ~/.vagrant.d/insecure_private_key:/home/bonita/.vagrant.d/insecure_private_key \
        quay.io/bonitasoft/bcd-controller /bin/bash
bonita@bcd-controller:~$ cd bonita-continuous-delivery
bonita@bcd-controller:~/bonita-continuous-delivery$
bonita@bcd-controller:~/bonita-continuous-delivery$bcd -s scenarios/vagrant_single.yml stack deploy
----

==== 3. Open Bonita URL

You should now be able to access Bonita Portal at *http://192.168.10.10:8081/bonita*.

==== 4. Cleaning up your environment

Before destroying your virtual machines, it is recommended to _undeploy_ your Bonita stack with BCD as follows:

[source,bash]
----
$ bcd -s <path/to/scenario> -y stack undeploy
----

Then you may destroy your virtual machine with the `vagrant destroy` command.

NOTE: You can read more about the Vagrant CLI on https://www.vagrantup.com/docs/cli/[Vagrant documentation site].
