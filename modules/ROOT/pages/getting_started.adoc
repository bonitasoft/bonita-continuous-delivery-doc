The BCD add-on is provided as a `bonita-continuous-delivery_<version>.zip` archive.

This page describes how to use this archive to start your journey with Bonita Continuous Delivery.

== Installation guide

In order to ease your environment setup, we provide a Docker image called *xref:bcd_controller.adoc[BCD Controller image]* which contains all required dependencies and tools for BCD. +
Then a *BCD Controller container* has to be started on the control host, ie. the host from which Bonita Continuous Delivery commands are launched.

. Make sure Docker is installed as described in the https://docs.docker.com/engine/installation/[Install Docker] documentation.
. Extract the `bonita-continuous-delivery_<version>.zip` archive:
+
[source,bash]
----
$ unzip bonita-continuous-delivery_<version>.zip
----
+
This step creates a `bonita-continuous-delivery_<version>` directory which contains Bonita Continuous Delivery Ansible playbooks and roles.
+
[WARNING]
====
For windows users install in user folder (C:\Users\XXX) (If not, Docker won't have the right to copy the volumes)
====
+
. Pull the `quay.io/bonitasoft/bcd-controller:<version>` Docker image from secured registry. +
The username corresponds to `bcd_registry_user` and the password corresponds to `bcd_registry_password` described in the xref:scenarios.adoc[Scenario file reference]. Both have been provided by your sales representative.
+
[source,bash]
----
$ docker login quay.io
Username: bonitasoft+john_doe_at_acme_com
Password:
Login Succeeded
$ docker pull quay.io/bonitasoft/bcd-controller:<version>
[...]
Status: Downloaded newer image for quay.io/bonitasoft/bcd-controller:<version>
$ docker logout quay.io
----
+
The `quay.io/bonitasoft/bcd-controller:<version>` Docker image is now available on the control host.
+
. Make sure BCD dependencies are present. +
BCD expects Bonita version-specific dependencies to be present in the `bonita-continuous-delivery_<version>/dependencies` directory. BCD dependencies are provided separately as a `quay.io/bonitasoft/bcd-dependencies:<bonita_version>` Docker data image. +
Basically, the `/dependencies` volume provided by the `quay.io/bonitasoft/bcd-dependencies` Docker image must be mounted or copied into the `dependencies` directory. For instance, here is how to create a Docker named volume with BCD dependencies from the data image:
+
[source,bash]
----
$ docker login quay.io
Username: bonitasoft+john_doe_at_acme_com
Password:
Login Succeeded
$ docker run --rm -v bcd-dependencies-<bonita_version>:/dependencies quay.io/bonitasoft/bcd-dependencies:<bonita_version>
$ docker logout quay.io
----
+
[WARNING]
====
For linux user make sure your `user id` and `group id` is `1000` or refer to the `Running BCD controller with user ID different from 1000` paragraph in xref:bcd_controller.adoc[BCD Controller image]
====
+
The `bcd-dependencies-<bonita_version>` Docker named volume is now available and can be mounted with your BCD Controller.
+
. Start a BCD Controller Docker container on the control host:
+
[source,bash]
----
$ docker run --rm -ti --hostname bcd-controller --name bcd-controller \
    -v <host_path_to_bonita-continuous-delivery_directory>:/home/bonita/bonita-continuous-delivery \
    -v bcd-dependencies-<bonita_version>:/home/bonita/bonita-continuous-delivery/dependencies/<bonita_version> \
    quay.io/bonitasoft/bcd-controller:<version> /bin/bash
----
+
This command bind mounts the _bonita-continuous-delivery_ directory and the _bcd-dependencies-<bonita_version>_ volume on the control host into the BCD controller container.

[NOTE]
====
You may also start a BCD Controller container using https://docs.docker.com/compose/[Docker Compose] as described in the xref:bcd_controller.adoc[BCD Controller image] detailed documentation.
====

=== Additional steps for Provisioning

[IMPORTANT]
====
The provisioning part of BCD is now **deprecated** and will be **removed** ! We do not recommend using it.
====

[NOTE]
====
The following installation steps are required when using BCD for *Provisioning Bonita stacks*. They are not required for Living Application Management.
====

==== Licensing prerequisites

While provisioning Bonita stacks, BCD automatically retrieves and installs Bonita licenses for the Bonita platform. Therefore, you must have an active Bonitasoft Subscription and a dedicated access to Bonitasoft license service in order to use BCD for Provisioning.

Contact your sales representative for more information.

==== AWS Prerequisites

If you consider deploying to Amazon Web Services (AWS) platform, first read the xref:aws_prerequisites.adoc[AWS prerequisites tutorial] which describes how to configure AWS for BCD.

BCD can create and delete https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/[AWS EC2 instances] automatically by making programmatic calls to AWS. In order to use this feature, you must provide AWS credentials, for example through a https://boto.readthedocs.io/en/latest/boto_config_tut.html[`.boto`] file. The content of a `.boto` file is as follows:

[source,ini]
----
[Credentials]
aws_access_key_id = <YOUR_AWS_ACCESS_KEY>
aws_secret_access_key = <YOUR_AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY>
----

Then the `.boto` file has to be mounted from the control host into the BCD controller while starting the container. Add the following option to the `docker run` command:

[source,bash]
----
-v <host_path_to_.boto_file>:/home/bonita/.boto
----

==== Azure Prerequisites

If you consider deploying to Microsoft Azure cloud computing platform, first read the xref:azure-prerequisites.adoc[Azure prerequisites tutorial] which describes how to configure Azure for BCD.

==== SSH key file

BCD uses SSH to communicate with target machines. Therefore the BCD controller must have access to the related SSH private key file. +
For AWS, this is the private part of your http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ec2-key-pairs.html[EC2 key pair] referenced in your AWS Console. +
With Azure, you will have to create an SSH key pair using https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-machines/linux/mac-create-ssh-keys[this tutorial on Linux or macOS] or https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-machines/linux/ssh-from-windows[this tutorial on Windows]. +
*:fa-exclamation-triangle: The SSH private key file must only be accessible from your user* (`chmod 600 <host_path_to_ssh_private_key_file>`).

Then the SSH private key file has to be mounted from the control host into the BCD controller while starting the container. Add the following option to the `docker run` command:

[source,bash]
----
-v <host_path_to_ssh_private_key_file>:/home/bonita/.ssh/<ssh_private_key>
----

== Complete installation example

Here is a complete example of how to install the BCD Controller Docker image.

WARNING: This example uses _fake_ AWS credentials and SSH private key... :-)

Assuming you have a `bonita-continuous-delivery_3.4.2.zip` archive in your `$HOME` directory:

[source,bash]
----
$ cd $HOME
$ unzip bonita-continuous-delivery_3.4.2.zip
[...]

$ docker login quay.io
Username: bonitasoft+john_doe_at_acme_com
Password:
Login Succeeded
$ docker pull quay.io/bonitasoft/bcd-controller:3.4.2
[...]
Status: Downloaded newer image for quay.io/bonitasoft/bcd-controller:3.4.2

$ cd $HOME/bonita-continuous-delivery_3.4.2/dependencies

$ docker run --rm -v bcd-dependencies-7.12.2:/dependencies quay.io/bonitasoft/bcd-dependencies:7.12.2
[...]

$ docker logout quay.io
----

The next steps of this example are required when using BCD to provision a Bonita stack on AWS.

[source,bash]
----
$ cat ~/.boto
[Credentials]
aws_access_key_id = AKO9PHAI7YOSHAEMOHS6
aws_secret_access_key = aicheeChe8Koh4aeSh3quum4tah8cohku3Hi8Eir

$ ls -n ~/.ssh/bonita_us-west-2.pem
-rw------- 1 1000 1000 1692 jul. 6 11:36 ~/.ssh/bonita_us-west-2.pem
----

Finally here is a sample command to start a BCD controller container:

[source,bash]
----
$ docker run --rm -ti --hostname bcd-controller --name bcd-controller \
        -v ~/bonita-continuous-delivery_3.4.2:/home/bonita/bonita-continuous-delivery \
        -v bcd-dependencies-7.12.2:/home/bonita/bonita-continuous-delivery/dependencies/7.12.2 \
        -v ~/.boto:/home/bonita/.boto \
        -v ~/.ssh/bonita_us-west-2.pem:/home/bonita/.ssh/bonita_us-west-2.pem \
        bonitasoft/bcd-controller /bin/bash
bonita@bcd-controller:~$
bonita@bcd-controller:~$ cd bonita-continuous-delivery
bonita@bcd-controller:~/bonita-continuous-delivery$
----

== Using Bonita Continuous Delivery add-on

[WARNING]
====

At this stage of the _Getting started_ guide, you should have a BCD controller container up and running.
====

=== Command Line Interface

From your BCD controller container, you can now run the `bcd` command to manage your Bonita stack and Living Application.

You can call `bcd` with the `--help` option to get available options and commands as follows:

[source,bash]
----
bonita@bcd-controller:~/bonita-continuous-delivery$ bcd --help
Usage: bcd [OPTIONS] COMMAND [ARGS]...

  Bonita Continuous Delivery CLI.

Options:
  -v, --verbose          Enable Ansible verbose mode
  -y, --yes              Execute action without confirmation prompt
  --nocolor              Turn output colorization off
  -s, --scenario PATH    YAML scenario file path - Optional if `BCD_SCENARIO`
                         environment variable is defined.
  -e, --extra-vars TEXT  Extra vars for Ansible (multiple) - Variables are
                         passed using the key=value syntax.
  -h, --help             Show this help message
  --version              Show the version and exit.

Commands:
  livingapp  Manage Bonita Living Application
  stack      Manage Bonita stack (infrastructure)
  version    Show BCD version information
----

[NOTE]
====

Read the *xref:bcd_cli.adoc[BCD Command-line interface]* page for further information about the BCD CLI usage.
====

=== Scenarios

BCD requires a YAML configuration file called *Scenario* which describes your infrastructure and the Bonita stack to deploy.

Example scenario files are provided in the *scenarios* directory, including:

* *uswest_performance.yml.EXAMPLE* - a scenario for both stack and living application management with AWS provisioning
* *azure_northEurope.yml.EXAMPLE* - a scenario for both stack and living application management with Azure provisioning
* *build_and_deploy.yml.EXAMPLE* - a scenario for living application management only
* *manage_licenses.yml.EXAMPLE* - a scenario for license management only

Use these examples to customize your scenario and save it with a `.yml` file extension.

[NOTE]
====

Read the *xref:scenarios.adoc[BCD Scenario reference]* page for a comprehensive description of scenario variables.
