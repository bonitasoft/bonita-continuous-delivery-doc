== Basic concepts

BCD offer include two Java command-line interfaces which allow to build and deploy Bonita Living Applications. You will be able to download the latest versions of the CLIs from our xref:{bonitaDocVersion}@bonita::bonita-repository-access.adoc[Bonita Artifact Repository] and then integrate the execution in your developer and CI pipelines.

IMPORTANT: BCD features do not require docker anyomore now. Usage has been greatly simplified. The only remaining xref:requirements-and-compatibility.adoc[prerequisites] are to have Java and Maven installed on the host running the CLIs.
