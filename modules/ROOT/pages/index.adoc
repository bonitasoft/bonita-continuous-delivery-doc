= Bonita Continuous Delivery

The Bonita Continuous Delivery (BCD) offer provides tools to setup _Continuous Delivery_ practice for your Bonita Living Application development and deployment.

BCD lets you build a Living Application from source code in a repository and deploy the generated artifacts from the command line.

== Basic concepts

*BCD* offer has evolved now into *two Java command-line interfaces (CLI)* which allow to `build` and `deploy` Bonita Living Applications. You will be able to download the latest versions of the CLIs from our xref:{bonitaDocVersion}@bonita::bonita-repository-access.adoc[Bonita Artifact Repository] and then integrate the execution in your developer and CI pipelines.

IMPORTANT: BCD features do not require docker anyomore. Usage has been greatly simplified. The only remaining xref:requirements-and-compatibility.adoc[prerequisites] are Java and Maven installed on the host running the CLIs.

TIP: For both CLIs you can use the https://www.mojohaus.org/exec-maven-plugin/[exec-maven-plugin] to include `build` and/or `deploy` step in the bonita project build lifecycle. +
(starting from version 7.13.x, a bonita project is a maven project)
