== What's new in 3.4.4

Stack and license commands are now **deprecated**.  These commands used for infrastructure provisioning rarely suited the diversity of our clients infrastructure stacks and specific hosting constraints.

We've decided to solely focus on the continuous integration to help you where we can make the most impact: Building and deploying easily your automation projects !

BCD Stack and license commands will soon be removed in the up-coming BCD versions.

If you are managing your stacks with BCD, we recommend using the following tools to replace BCD stack feature for your provisioning:

|===
|Ansible             | Configuration management
|Terraform           | Infrastructure automation
|boto3, aws cli      | Manage AWS credentials and services
|Azure SDK for Python| To create, configure, and manage Azure services
|===

[TIP]
====
If you don't feel like managing infrastructure at all anymore, you may also want to have a look at our hosted offer (which include a ready to use CI solution) : link:https://www.bonitasoft.com/bonita-cloud[image:https://www.bonitasoft.com/system/files/Cloud/bonita_cloud_200.png["Bonita Cloud",30,30] Bonita Cloud]

with the zip distribution.

From now (and for previous versions), make sure to always specify the BCD version when using `BCD Controller` docker image.
