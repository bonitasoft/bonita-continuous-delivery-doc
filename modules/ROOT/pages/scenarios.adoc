= BCD Scenario reference

Scenarios enable you to define your infrastructure and Bonita stack. A scenario is a YAML Ansible variable file that BCD injects to the underlying Ansible playbooks. Its syntax basically follows http://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/reference_appendices/YAMLSyntax.html[Ansible's YAML syntax].

The variables described in a scenario have precedence over those defined in the playbooks or the group vars. It is still possible to overload scenario variables with `--extra-vars` declaration in the `bcd` command line. For instance overloading `bonita_version` can be interesting if you want to test multiple versions of Bonita without duplicating scenario files.

NOTE: Example scenario files are provided in the *scenarios* directory:

* *uswest_performance.yml.EXAMPLE* - a scenario for both stack and living application management with AWS provisioning
* *azure_northEurope.yml.EXAMPLE* - a scenario for both stack and living application management with Azure provisioning
* *static_inventory.yml.EXAMPLE* - a scenario for both stack and living application management with static inventory
* *build_and_deploy.yml.EXAMPLE* - a scenario for living application management only

Use these examples to customize your scenario and save it with a `.yml` file extension.
