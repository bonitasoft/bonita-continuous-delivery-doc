= Migrate from an earlier version of BCD

== Overview

This page explains how to upgrade your version of BCD.

== How it works

=== From a 3.6.x towards {bcdVersion}

. Remove all BCD docker images since they are useless now.
. Configure your access to xref:{bonitaDocVersion}@bonita::bonita-repository-access.adoc[Bonita Artifact Repository]
. Follow the CLIs (xref:builder.adoc[Builder] and xref:deployer.adoc[Deployer]) documentations
. Delete useless scenario files (pass parameters as arguments to the CLI)
